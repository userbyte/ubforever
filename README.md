## the fuck is this?
a simple program that acts as a parent process which restarts a child program automatically if it crashes

## why?
you dont feel like setting up something like a systemd service for autorestarting, then this is a simple alternative

## how do i use this?
you probably dont want to but i may or may not add proper instructions in the future, for now just figure it out i guess
