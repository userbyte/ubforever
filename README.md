# ubforever

### the fuck is this?
a simple program that acts as a parent process which restarts a child program automatically if it crashes

### why?
you dont feel like setting up something like a systemd service for autorestarting, then this is a simple alternative

### how do i use this?
you probably dont want to, and i dont feel like adding proper instructions atm so figure it out ig lol

### whats up with the name? it sounds stupid as fuck tbh
yeah idk i called it that like 3 years go and never cared enough to come up with something better. ig ubforever kinda makes sense tho since its main goal is to make a process run forever, and i only added "ub" (abbreviation of my name userbyte) so its not just called *forever*
