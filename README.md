# ubforever

### the fuck is this?
a simple program that acts as a parent process which restarts a child program automatically if it crashes

### why?
if you dont feel like setting up something like a systemd service for autorestarting, then this is a simple alternative

### how do i use this?
you probably dont want to, and i dont feel like adding proper instructions atm so figure it out ig lol

### ok... how install?
you can install it manually by cloning this repo or you can use a little script i made that just does everything for you

**one-liner install:** ```curl https://userbyte.xyz/downloads/dl-and-install-ubf.sh | sh```

*note: piping straight to sh is sus and you should read over the script before doing so, though i would never put anything malicious cuz im not a cunt*

this install script should result in `ubf` and `ubfm` command being available in your PATH

### whats up with the name? it sounds stupid as fuck tbh
yeah idk i called it that like 3 years go and never cared enough to come up with something better. ig ubforever kinda makes sense tho since its main goal is to make a process run forever, and i only added "ub" (abbreviation of my name userbyte) so its not just called *forever*
